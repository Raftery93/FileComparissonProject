brought the ship into harbor, and shoved a bridge on to the land, and
Thorvald went ashore with all his company. He said then, “Here it is
fair, and here would I like to raise my dwelling.” They went then to
the ship, and saw upon the sands within the headland three heights;
and they went thither, and saw there three skin-boats, and three men
under each. Then they divided their people, and laid hands on them all,
except one that got off with his boat. They killed these eight, and
went then back to the headland, and looked about them there, and saw
in the firth some heights, and thought they were dwellings. After that
there came a heaviness on them so great that they could not keep awake;
and all slumbered. Then came a call above them, so that they all awoke.
Thus said the call, “Awake, Thorvald, and all thy company, if thou
wilt keep thy life; and fare thou to thy ship, and all thy men, and
fare from the land of the quickest.”[28] Then came from the firth
innumerable skin-boats, and made toward them.

Thorvald said then, “We will set up our battle-shields, and guard
ourselves the best we can, but fight little against them.” So they did,
and the Skraelings[29] shot at them for a while, but then fled, each as
fast as he could. Then Thorvald asked his men if any of them was hurt:
they said they were not hurt. “I have got a hurt under the arm,” said
he; “for an arrow flew between the bulwarks and the shield under my arm;
and here is the arrow, and that will be my death. Now I counsel that ye
make ready as quickly as may be to return; but ye shall bear me to the
headland which I thought the likeliest place to build. It may be it
was a true word I spoke, that I should dwell there for a time. There
ye shall bury me, and set crosses at my head and feet, and call it
Krossanes[30] henceforth.” Greenland was then Christianized; but Eirek
the Red had died before Christianity came thither.

Now Thorvald died; but they did every thing according as he had said,
and then went and found their companions, and told each other the news
they had to tell, and lived there that winter, and gathered grapes and
vines for loading the ship. Then in the spring they made ready to sail
for Greenland, and came with their ship to Eireksfirth, and had great
tidings to tell to Leif.





  [Karlsefni, a rich Norwegian, came to Greenland, staid at
  Leif’s house, married a wife, and was finally persuaded to bring
  a colony of sixty men and five women to Vinland.]

THIS agreement made Karlsefni and his seamen, that they should have
even handed[31] all that they should get in the way of goods. They had
with them all sorts of cattle, as they thought to settle there if they
might. Karlsefni begged Leif for his house in Vinland; but he said
he would lend him the house, but not give it. Then they bore out to
the sea with the ship, and came to Leif’s booths, hale and whole, and
landed there their cattle. There soon came into their hands a great and
good prize; for a whale was driven ashore, both great and good; then
they went to cut up the whale, and had no scarcity of food. The cattle
went up into the country; and it soon happened that the male cattle
became wild and unruly. They had with them a bull. Karlsefni had wood
felled, and brought to the ship, and had the wood piled on the cliff to
dry. They had all the good things of the country, both of grapes, and
of all sorts of game and other things.


After the first winter came the summer; then they saw appear the
Skraelings, and there came from out the wood a great number of men.
Near by were their neat-cattle; and the bull took to bellowing, and
roared loudly, whereat the Skraelings were frightened, and ran off
with their bundles. These were furs and sable-skins, and skin-wares
of all kinds. And they turned toward Karlsefni’s booths, and wanted to
get into the house; but Karlsefni had the doors guarded. Neither party
understood the other’s language. Then the Skraelings took down their
bags, and opened them, and offered them for sale, and wanted, above all,
to have weapons for them. But Karlsefni forbade them to sell weapons.
He took this plan: he bade the women bring out their dairy-stuff[32]
for them; and, so soon as they saw this, they would have that, and
nothing more. Now this was the way the Skraelings traded: they bore
off their wares in their stomachs. But Karlsefni and his companions had
their bags and skin-wares, and so they parted. Now hereof is this to
say, that Karlsefni had posts driven strongly round about his booths,
and made all complete. At this time Gudrid, the wife of Karlsefni,
bore a man-child, and he was called Snorri. In the beginning of the
next winter the Skraelings came to them again, and were many more than
before; and they had the same wares as before. Then Karlsefni said to
the women, “Now bring forth the same food that was most liked before,
and no other.” And, when they saw it, they cast their bundles in over
the fence.... [But one of them being killed by one of Karlsefni’s men,
they all fled in haste, and left their garments and wares behind.]
“Now I think we need a good counsel,” said Karlsefni; “for I think
they will come for the third time in anger, and with many men. Now we
must do this: ten men must go out on that ness,[33] and show themselves
there; but another party must go into the wood, and hew a place for our
neat-cattle when the foe shall come from the wood; and we must take the
bull, and let him go before us.” But thus it was with the place where
they thought to meet, that a lake was on one side, and the wood on the
other. Now it was done as Karlsefni had said. Now came the Skraelings
to the place where Karlsefni had thought should be the battle; and now
there was a battle, and many of the Skraelings fell.

There was one large and handsome man among the Skraelings; and
Karlsefni thought he might be their leader. Now one of the Skraelings
had taken up an axe, and looked at it a while, and struck at one of his
fellows, and hit him, whereupon he fell dead; then the large man took
the axe, and looked at it a while, and threw it into the sea as far
as he could. But after that they fled to the wood, each as fast as he
could; and thus ended the strife. Karlsefni and his companions were
there all that winter; but in the spring Karlsefni said he would stay
there no longer, and would fare to Greenland. Now they made ready for
the voyage, and bare thence much goods, namely, grape-vines and grapes
and skin-wares. Now they sailed into the sea, and came whole with their
ships to Eireksfirth, and were there that winter.
