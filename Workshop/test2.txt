NOW Thorvald made ready for this voyage with thirty men, with the
counsel thereon of Leif, his brother. Then they fitted out their ship,
and bore out to sea (A.D. 1002): and there is nothing told of their
voyage before they came to Vinland, to Leif’s booths; and they laid up
their ship, and dwelt in peace there that winter, and caught fish for
their meat. But in the spring, Thorvald said they would get ready their
ship, and send their long-boat, and some men with it, along to the
westward of the land, and explore it during the summer. The land seemed
to them fair and woody, and narrow between the woods and the sea, and
of white sand. There were many islands and great shoals. They found
neither man’s abode nor beast’s; but, on an island to the westward,
they found a corn-shed of wood. More works of men they found not; and
they went back, and came to Leif’s booths in the fall. But the next
summer fared Thorvald eastward with the merchant-ship, and coasted to
the northward. Here a heavy storm arose as they were passing one of two
capes, and drove them up there, and broke the keel under the ship; and
they dwelt there long, and mended their ship. Then said Thorvald to his
companions, “Now will I that we raise up here the keel on the ness,[25]
and call it Keelness;”[26] and so they did.

After that, they sailed thence, and coasted to the eastward, and
into the mouths of the firths[27] that were nearest to them, and to a
headland that stretched out. This was all covered with wood: here they
brought the ship into harbor, and shoved a bridge on to the land, and
Thorvald went ashore with all his company. He said then, “Here it is
fair, and here would I like to raise my dwelling.” They went then to
the ship, and saw upon the sands within the headland three heights;
and they went thither, and saw there three skin-boats, and three men
under each. Then they divided their people, and laid hands on them all,
except one that got off with his boat. They killed these eight, and
went then back to the headland, and looked about them there, and saw
in the firth some heights, and thought they were dwellings. After that
there came a heaviness on them so great that they could not keep awake;
and all slumbered. Then came a call above them, so that they all awoke.
Thus said the call, “Awake, Thorvald, and all thy company, if thou
wilt keep thy life; and fare thou to thy ship, and all thy men, and
fare from the land of the quickest.”[28] Then came from the firth
innumerable skin-boats, and made toward them.

Thorvald said then, “We will set up our battle-shields, and guard
ourselves the best we can, but fight little against them.” So they did,
and the Skraelings[29] shot at them for a while, but then fled, each as
fast as he could. Then Thorvald asked his men if any of them was hurt:
they said they were not hurt. “I have got a hurt under the arm,” said
he; “for an arrow flew between the bulwarks and the shield under my arm;
and here is the arrow, and that will be my death. Now I counsel that ye
make ready as quickly as may be to return; but ye shall bear me to the
headland which I thought the likeliest place to build. It may be it
was a true word I spoke, that I should dwell there for a time. There
ye shall bury me, and set crosses at my head and feet, and call it
Krossanes[30] henceforth.” Greenland was then Christianized; but Eirek
the Red had died before Christianity came thither.

Now Thorvald died; but they did every thing according as he had said,
and then went and found their companions, and told each other the news
they had to tell, and lived there that winter, and gathered grapes and
vines for loading the ship. Then in the spring they made ready to sail
for Greenland, and came with their ship to Eireksfirth, and had great
tidings to tell to Leif.
